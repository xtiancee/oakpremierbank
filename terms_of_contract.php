We may revoke any waiver upon notice to you. How do you consent to the Agreement and any future modification to the Agreement? By signing the application for a deposit account or using your account or service you consent to the terms of this Agreement. Continuing to maintain or use the account or service after a modification to the Agreement or removal of a fee waiver becomes effective is considered your consent to those changes. A copy of the current Agreement will include modifications described in your account statement or otherwise communicated to you. You can obtain a copy of the current Agreement anytime by requesting it from a banker or at oakpremierbank.com. What happens if a term of the Agreement is determined to be invalid? Any term of the Agreement that is inconsistent with the laws governing your account will be considered to be modified by us and applied in a manner consistent with such laws. Any term of the Agreement that a court of competent jurisdiction determines to be invalid will be modified accordingly. In either case, the modification will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining terms of the Agreement. With whom will we communicate about your account? We may provide you or an authorized signer with information about your account. When we receive information from an authorized signer, we treat it as a communication from you. You agree to notify us promptly in writing if an authorized signer no longer has authority on your account. Resolving disputes through arbitration (Consumer accounts only) Arbitration Agreement between you and Oak Premier If you have a dispute, we hope to resolve it as quickly and easily as possible.

Binding arbitration means the decision of the arbitrator is final and enforceable. A dispute is any unresolved disagreement between Oak Premier and you. A dispute may also include a disagreement about this Arbitration Agreement’s meaning, application, or enforcement. Oak Premier and you each agrees to waive the right to a jury trial or a trial in front of a judge in a public court. This Arbitration Agreement has only one exception: Either Oak Premier or you may still take any dispute to small claims court. Arbitration is beneficial because it provides a legally binding decision in a more streamlined, cost-effective manner than a typical court case. But, the benefit of arbitration is diminished if either Oak Premier or you refuse to submit to arbitration following a lawful demand. Thus, the party that does not agree to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand must pay all of the  other party’s costs and expenses for compelling arbitration. Can either Oak Premier or you participate in class or representative actions? No, neither Oak Premier nor you will be entitled to join or consolidate disputes by or against others as a representative or member of a class, to act in any arbitration in the nterests of the general public, or to act as a private attorney general. If any provision related to a class action, class arbitration, private attorney general action, other representative action, joinder, or consolidation is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable.

                          <p class="text-dark" style="text-align:justify">Arbitration means an impartial third party will hear the dispute between Oak Premier and you and provide a decision. Binding arbitration means the decision of the arbitrator is final and enforceable. A “dispute” is any unresolved disagreement between Oak Premier and you. A “dispute” may also include a disagreement about this Arbitration Agreement’s meaning, application, or enforcement.</p>
                          
                           <p>Except as stated in “No waiver of self-help or provisional remedies” below, Oak Premier and you agree, at Oak Premier’s or your request, to submit to binding arbitration all claims, disputes, and controversies between or among Oak Premier and you (and their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and other agents), whether in tort, contract or otherwise arising out of or relating in any way to your account(s) and/or service(s), and their negotiation, execution, administration, modification, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default, or termination (each, a “dispute”). DISPUTES SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION ARE NOT RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WELLS FARGO AND YOU EACH IRREVOCABLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT EACH MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE ARBITRATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. Aside from self-help remedies, this Arbitration Agreement has only one exception: Either Oak Premier or you may still take any dispute to small claims court. Arbitration is beneficial because it provides a legally binding decision in a more streamlined, cost-effective manner than a typical court case. But, the benefit of arbitration is diminished if either Oak Premier or you refuse to submit to arbitration following a lawful demand. Thus, the party that does not agree to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand by the other party must pay all of the other party’s costs and expenses for compelling arbitration. </p> 
                           
                            <p>Can either Oak Premier or you participate in class or representative actions? No, Oak Premier and you agree that the resolution of any dispute arising pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be resolved by a separate arbitration proceeding and will not be consolidated with other disputes or treated as a class. Neither Oak Premier nor you will be entitled to join or consolidate disputes by or against others as a representative or member of a class, to act in any arbitration in the interests of the general public, or to act as a private attorney general. If any provision related to a class action, class arbitration, private attorney general action, other representative action, joinder, or consolidation is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable. </p>

If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and any such rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein will control. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a lawful demand by any other party will bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any dispute. What are the Arbitrator qualifications and powers? Any dispute in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the rules, and who will not render an award of greater than $5,000,000. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 will be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. Each arbitrator will be a neutral attorney licensed in the state whose laws govern your account, or a neutral, retired judge in such state, in either case with a minimum of ten years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator(s) will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator(s) will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the discretion of the arbitrator(s)) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator(s) will resolve all disputes in accordance with the substantive law of the state whose laws govern your account and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator(s) will also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions, and to take such other action as deemed necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure, the state rules of civil procedure for the state whose laws govern your account, or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy will not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief. Is discovery permitted in arbitration? Yes, in any arbitration proceeding, discovery will be permitted in accordance with the rules. All discovery will be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later han 20 days before the hearing date.

Yes, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Oak Premier and you each retains the right to pursue in small claims court a dispute within that court’s jurisdiction. Further, this arbitration agreement will apply only to disputes in which either party seeks to recover an amount of money (excluding attorneys’ fees and costs) that exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court. </p>

                           <p>
                        Yes. We may benefit from having the use of funds in customers’ non-interest earning accounts. We may use these funds to reduce our borrowing from other sources such as the Fed Funds market or invest them in short-term investments such as its Federal Reserve Account. This benefit may be referred to as spread. It is not possible to quantify the benefit to us that may be attributable to a particular customer’s funds because funds from all customers’ non-interest earning accounts are aggregated both for purposes of reducing our borrowing costs and for investment and because our use of funds may vary depending on a number of factors including interest rates, Federal Funds rates, credit risks and our anticipated funding needs. Our use of funds as described in this paragraph has no effect or impact on your use of and access to funds in your account.

You authorize your wireless operator to disclose your mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers  (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber and device details, if available, to Oak Premier and service providers for the duration of the business relationship, solely for identity  verification and fraud avoidance. Review our Privacy Policy for how we treat your data.  You represent that you are the owner of the mobile phone number or have the delegated legal authority to act on behalf of the mobile subscriber to provide this consent. Are you responsible for paying taxes? Yes, fees may be subject to state and local sales taxes, which vary by location, and will be assessed as appropriate. You also agree to pay an amount equal to any other applicable taxes, including backup withholding tax. What is the applicable exchange rate? The applicable exchange rate is the exchange rate we set and use for you when we convert  one currency to another currency. It includes a markup over our cost of sourcing the  relevant currency. The markup factors include without limitation costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from Rights and responsibilities
